# Project Proposal

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deliver a proof of concept of the patient profile functionality of a new patient health record management system for the local district health board. The patient profile management system will be an application that will store patient information and give healthcare providers and patients the ability to view and manage this information. The information stored by this system will be

Patients personal information:

Full name
Phone number
Email address
Residential address
Date of birth
Unique ID
Photo

Patients medical information:

Current healthcare provider
Medical history
Diagnoses
Test results
Medications

The application will be developed using the Agile XP software development model and delivered to the healthcare provider. It will provide all the fields of a patient profile described above, and use the CLI (command line interface) to take user input in order to manage, change, add profiles, or delta profiles. The proof of concept of this system will be presented to the healthcare provider in a time span of three weeks.
