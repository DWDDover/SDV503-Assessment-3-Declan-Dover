# Project Proposal

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deliver a proof of concept of the patient profile functionality of a new patient health record management system for the local district health board. The patient profile management system will be an application that will store patient information and give healthcare providers and patients the ability to view and manage this information. The information stored by this system will be

Patients personal information:

Full name
Phone number
Email address
Residential address
Date of birth
Unique ID
Photo

Patients medical information:

Current healthcare provider
Medical history
Diagnoses
Test results
Medications

The application will be developed using the Agile XP software development model and delivered to the healthcare provider. It will provide all the fields of a patient profile described above, and use the CLI (command line interface) to take user input in order to manage, change, add profiles, or delta profiles. The proof of concept of this system will be presented to the healthcare provider in a time span of three weeks.

## Project Timeline



## Project Management

For this project the Agile XP (Extreme Programming) software development methodology will be used. Agile XP focuses on frequent and continuous feedback, collaboration, and adaptation in order to deliver a product that meets all the defined requirements within a timeframe. The key measure of progress in the development cycle is working software. This is achieved through pair programming, meaning code will be developed and reviewed collaboratively throughout the project, continuous integration, meaning each change will be integrated and tested as it is completed, short iterations, meaning frequent iterations will be delivered in order to receive feedback to be used in the next iteration, and test-driven development, meaning tests will be defined before the code is written in order to ensure a high level of reliability and accuracy. GitHub Projects will be used to track progress on tasks and receive frequent feedback from collaborators.


## Proof of Concept

A proof of concept of the application will be developed for the healthcare provider. This will be the patient profile part of the application and will have two types of end-user, a patient and a health professional. It will create a sample dataset of patients containing all the fields listed in the project overview and will take input from the CLI (command line interface) to display and edit patient information. The program will include functionality to:

Display patient information
Return a list of patients based on input of a field such as name or unique ID
Edit individual fields within a patients data
Create new patients
Delete patients

The proof of concept will have data validation for input and undergo testing of any many cases as possible before deployment.

## Evaluation

The success of this project will be defined by how closely the deployed product matches the requirements set out in the initial phases of development, milestones being achieved in the set time frames, and successful testing in multiple different scenarios and cases. The adherence of the code to DRY (donâ€™t repeat yourself) will also be a good marker of the project's success. Feedback after completion from various parties will also provide some insight on the project's success.

## Conclusion

This proposal outlines a solid, robust plan to implement the proof of concept of the patient management system within a short timeframe. The system will contain all necessary functionality to manage patient profiles and give healthcare providers a more efficient way to manage the data of their patients. The system will undergo extensive testing and using Agile XP will be developed iteratively, adjusting to changing requirements and feedback throughout the project. Because of all the above reasons the final deliverable software will be a great solution for any healthcare provider aiming to better manage their patients medical information.
